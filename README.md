# ðŸ–¤ðŸ’› Ã™dba

_Ã™dba_ is a [Kashubian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashubia) word for _idea_. Initially, the idea was to built a small modular thing, that could be probably called a framework (yes, another!). Now, the idea _shifted_ to have some generic components that can be integrated in any application. The main target for those components are the applications built from scratch that misses some things (i.e., a CLI component).
